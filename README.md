my deep learning experiments

**catvsDog.ipynb** applies fine tuning and transfer learning on vgg network for cat and dog classification from images 

**catvsDog_resnet.ipynb** applies finetuned Resnet Model for cat and dog prediction, Which achives accuracy of more than **99%** accuracy

**flowers_classification_98.4.ipynb** applies finetuned Xception network for classifying flowers and achieved more than 
**98%** accuracy

**traffic_sign_lenet.ipynb** classifies traffic signs(german traffic sign dataset) using a convolutional neural network trained from scratch. Data augmentation helps the classifier to improve the test set accuracy(**more than 98%**).

**Autoencoder.ipynb** implements normal autoencoder network(a network that can reconstruct its input) and denoising autoencoder(it reconstructs real input from noisy input data)

**VAEcolab.ipynb** implements Variational autoencoder network, applied on MNIST dataset

**GANcolab.ipynb** implements Generative Adverserial network, that reconstructs its input. MNIST dataset is used as input.
