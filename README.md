# Deep-learning-
my deep learning experiments

**catvsDog.ipynb** applies fine tuning and transfer learning on vgg network for cat and dog classification from images 

**catvsDog_resnet.ipynb** applies finetuned Resnet Model for cat and dog prediction, Which achives accuracy of more than **99%** accuracy

**flowers_classification_98.4.ipynb** applies finetuned Xception network for classifying flowers and achieved more than 
**98%** accuracy

**traffic_sign_lenet.ipynb** classifies traffic signs(german traffic sign dataset) using a convolutional neural network trained from scratch. Data augmentation helps the classifier to improve the test set accuracy(**more than 98%**).

**Autoencoder.ipynb** implements normal autoencoder network(a network reconstructs its input) and denoising autoencoder(network recostructs its real input from noisy data)
